# Arrow Router Demo

This is a visual demo of the [Arrow Router library](https://github.com/Arrow-air/lib-router). It is a simple web app that allows you to genenerate a number of random locations around San Francisco, and find the shortest route between any two nodes for a given aircraft type.

```bash
cd backend
cargo run
